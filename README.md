## Skip gram model

The skip-gram model is a popular neural network-based technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and word embedding tasks. It is a part of the word2vec family of algorithms developed by Tomas Mikolov and his team at Google. The skip-gram model is specifically designed to learn word embeddings, which are vector representations of words that capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words in a text corpus


## Word Context
The central idea of the skip-gram model is to predict the context words (words that appear nearby) for a given target word within a specific window of text. The model takes a large corpus of text as input.

## Word Vector Initialization
Each word in the vocabulary is initialized with a unique vector representation. These vectors are typically initialized randomly or with small random values.

## Training
The skip-gram model is trained using a neural network. Given a target word, the model tries to maximize the probability of the surrounding context words appearing within a certain window. This is done using techniques like stochastic gradient descent.

## Word Embeddings
After training, the word vectors serve as embeddings for words. These embeddings can be used in various downstream NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and document classification. The vectors capture semantic relationships, allowing you to perform operations like word similarity and analogy.
